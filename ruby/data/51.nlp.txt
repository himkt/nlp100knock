Natural
language
processing
NLP
is
a
field
of
computer
science
As
such
NLP
is
related
to
the
area
of
humanicomputer
interaction
Many
challenges
in
NLP
involve
natural
language
understanding
The
history
of
NLP
generally
starts
in
the
1950s
In
1950
Alan
Turing
published
an
article
titled
Computing
Machinery
and
Intelligence
which
proposed
what
is
now
called
the
Turing
test
as
a
criterion
of
intelligence
The
Georgetown
experiment
in
1954
involved
fully
automatic
translation
of
more
than
sixty
Russian
sentences
into
English
The
authors
claimed
that
within
three
or
five
years
However
ALPAC
report
in
1966
Little
further
research
in
machine
translation
was
conducted
until
the
late
1980s
Some
notably
successful
NLP
systems
developed
in
the
1960s
were
SHRDLU
ELIZA
Rogerian
psychotherapist
Joseph
Weizenbaum
between
1964
to
1966
Using
almost
no
information
about
human
thought
or
emotion
ELIZA
sometimes
provided
a
startlingly
humanlike
interaction
When
the
patient
exceeded
the
very
small
knowledge
base
ELIZA
might
provide
a
generic
response
My
head
hurts
with
Why
do
you
say
your
head
hurts
During
the
1970s
many
programmers
began
to
write
conceptual
ontologies
Examples
are
MARGIE
Schank
SAM
Cullingford
PAM
Wilensky
TaleSpin
Meehan
QUALM
Lehnert
Politics
Carbonell

Up
to
the
1980s
NLP
systems
were
based
on
complex
sets
of
handwritten
rules
Starting
in
the
late
1980s
NLP
with
the
introduction
of
machine
learning
algorithms
for
language
processing
This
was
due
to
both
the
steady
increase
in
computational
power
resulting
from
Moores
Law
and
the
gradual
lessening
of
the
dominance
of
Chomskyan
theories
of
linguistics
eg
Some
of
the
earliestused
machine
learning
algorithms
However
Part
of
speech
tagging
introduced
the
use
of
Hidden
Markov
Models
to
NLP
The
cache
language
models
upon
which
many
speech
recognition
systems
now
rely
are
examples
of
such
statistical
models
Such
models
are
generally
more
robust
when
given
unfamiliar
input
Many
of
the
notable
early
successes
occurred
in
the
field
of
machine
translation
IBM
Research
These
systems
were
able
to
take
advantage
of
existing
multilingual
textual
corpora
that
had
been
produced
by
the
Parliament
of
Canada
and
the
European
Union
as
a
result
of
laws
calling
for
the
translation
of
all
governmental
proceedings
into
all
official
languages
of
the
corresponding
systems
of
government
However
As
a
result
Recent
research
has
increasingly
focused
on
unsupervised
and
semisupervised
learning
algorithms
Such
algorithms
are
able
to
learn
from
data
that
has
not
been
handannotated
with
the
desired
answers
Generally
However
World
Wide
Web
Modern
NLP
algorithms
are
based
on
machine
learning
The
paradigm
of
machine
learning
is
different
from
that
of
most
prior
attempts
at
language
processing
Prior
implementations
of
languageprocessing
tasks
typically
involved
the
direct
hand
coding
of
large
sets
of
rules
The
machinelearning
paradigm
calls
instead
for
using
general
learning
algorithms

often
A
corpus
plural
Many
different
classes
of
machine
learning
algorithms
have
been
applied
to
NLP
tasks
These
algorithms
take
as
input
a
large
set
of
features
that
are
generated
from
the
input
data
Some
of
the
earliestused
algorithms
Increasingly
Such
models
have
the
advantage
that
they
can
express
the
relative
certainty
of
many
different
possible
answers
rather
than
only
one
The
learning
procedures
used
during
machine
learning
automatically
focus
on
the
most
common
cases
Automatic
learning
procedures
can
make
use
of
statistical
inference
algorithms
to
produce
models
that
are
robust
to
unfamiliar
input
eg
Generally
Systems
based
on
automatically
learning
the
rules
can
be
made
more
accurate
simply
by
supplying
more
input
data
However

The
subfield
of
NLP
devoted
to

known
as
